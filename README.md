In this document you will find a detailed breakdown of the steps that I took to design, implement and deploy a microservice for the Trails website. 
This microservice is designed to manage functionalities such as trail information, user roles and interactions between users and trails. 
The service allows users to view available trails while providing admin with the ability to add, update, or delete trail information
